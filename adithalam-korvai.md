# Lesson 4: Adi Tala Korvai

## What is a Korvai?

A korvai is a structured rhythmic pattern that is repeated and completed to land precisely on the starting beat of the tala cycle.

In this lesson, I practiced a korvai in Adi Tala, which follows an 8-beat cycle.  
The goal of a korvai is to maintain structure, repetition, and correct landing at the end of the cycle.

## Tala Structure (Adi Tala)

Adi Tala follows an 8-beat cycle:

1 2 3 4 | 5 6 | 7 8

The korvai must fit within this structure and resolve correctly at the end of the cycle.

## Patterns I Learned (typed from my notes)

The following korvai patterns repeat and resolve within the Adi Tala cycle.

Tha ka dhi mi Tha ka jo nu | Tha dhin gi na thom (repeat)

Tha dhin gi na thom Tha ka dhi mi | Tha dhin gi na thom (repeat)

Tha ka dhi mi | Tha ka dhi mi | Tha dhin gi na thom (final landing)

Each pattern is repeated in structured sequences and must land correctly at the start of the tala cycle.

All korvai patterns must resolve accurately within the Adi Tala structure.


## Understanding the Korvai Structure

While practicing korvai patterns, I noticed that repetition and structure are very important.

A korvai usually follows this format:

pattern → repeat → repeat → final landing

Each repetition must stay aligned with the tala cycle, and the final phrase must land correctly on the starting beat.

This requires careful counting and consistency.

## Understanding the Structure

While practicing this korvai, I noticed that:

- patterns repeat in structured sequences  
- each repetition must stay aligned with the tala  
- the final pattern must land exactly on the starting beat  

This requires careful counting and consistency.

## Thinking in Repetition and Cycles

A korvai uses repetition and structure.

For example:
pattern → repeat → repeat → final landing  

This showed me that rhythm can be built using repeating structured sequences.

Maintaining alignment across repetitions improves timing and control.

---

## Early Connections I Notice (Patterns & Logic)

Practicing korvai patterns feels similar to structured sequences where:

- steps repeat  
- timing must remain consistent  
- final result must land at correct position  

This made me think about how repetition and structure are important in both rhythm and logical systems.
