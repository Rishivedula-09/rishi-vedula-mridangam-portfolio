# Big Picture: Why This Project Exists

## Where This Journey Began

My interest in rhythm and structured patterns started early through learning mridangam, a classical Indian percussion instrument.

I have been learning mridangam for more than 7 years.  
Over time, this also led me to explore other percussion instruments such as:

• Marimba  
• Snare drum  
• School band percussion  

Through consistent practice, I began noticing that rhythm was not only about music — it involved structure, counting, balance, and pattern recognition.

This slowly built my curiosity about how rhythm connects to mathematics, logic, and systems.

## Expanding Through Performance and Team Experience

In 9th grade, I joined my high school band as a percussionist.

As part of the band:

• I performed during school events and football games  
• Traveled with the band to support the school team  
• Practiced and performed as part of a coordinated group  

This experience taught me:

• timing within a team  
• synchronization  
• discipline in practice  
• performance under structure  

It also showed me how structured rhythm connects to teamwork and coordination.

## A Moment That Sparked Deeper Curiosity

In Summer 2024, during a family trip to Paris and Switzerland, I visited the Louvre Museum.

There I learned about Leonardo da Vinci — not only as an artist, but also as a mathematician, engineer, and thinker who used:

• geometry  
• proportion  
• patterns  
• coded design  
• structured systems  

This was the first time I began thinking seriously about how:

music  
math  
design  
and patterns  

could all be connected.

That visit became the starting point of deeper curiosity about how structured thinking appears across different fields.

## From Curiosity to Exploration

During 10th and early 11th grade, I continued exploring these ideas whenever I had time.

I used:

• library resources  
• online research  
• discussions with teachers  
• observation from music practice  

I began asking questions such as:

• How does rhythm connect to mathematical structure?  
• How do repeating patterns work across systems?  
• Can rhythm be viewed like an algorithm?  
• How do structured patterns scale while staying balanced?  

At this stage, I had curiosity — but not yet a clear direction.

## Building the Project

In early 11th grade, I decided to document my learning and observations.

Initially, this was challenging because:

• It was difficult to explain connections clearly  
• I was unsure how to connect music with real-world systems  
• I did not know how to structure the project  

With guidance from my parents and continued reflection, I began shaping this into a structured long-term portfolio.

The goal became:

to document rhythm  
to analyze structure  
to explore connections  
to develop deeper understanding over time  

This project is still evolving and will continue to grow as I learn more.

## What This Project Represents

This is not just a music documentation project.

It represents a long-term effort to explore how structured thinking appears across different domains:

• music  
• mathematics  
• computer science  
• systems and design  

Through rhythm practice and structured writing, I am learning how:

patterns scale  
systems stay balanced  
repetition creates structure  
precision affects outcomes  

I am documenting this journey as a way to understand how structured thinking applies to real-world problem solving.

## Looking Forward

As I continue learning, I hope to deepen my understanding of:

• mathematical patterns  
• algorithmic thinking  
• system design  
• structured problem solving  

I plan to keep expanding this portfolio with:

• more lessons  
• deeper analysis  
• video demonstrations  
• clearer real-world connections  

This project represents an ongoing learning journey — not a finished result.

## Purpose of This Portfolio

This portfolio documents:

• long-term music training  
• structured thinking development  
• curiosity-driven exploration  
• connections across disciplines  

It reflects how my interests are evolving and how I am learning to apply structured thinking across different areas.
