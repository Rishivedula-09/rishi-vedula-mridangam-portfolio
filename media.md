## Practice Videos (Coming Soon)

I plan to add short videos (3–5 minutes each) demonstrating basic rhythm patterns at slow and normal speeds. These videos will focus on clarity and structure rather than performance.

## Photos (Coming Soon)

Photos from practice sessions, lessons, and community performances will be added gradually to show how my learning has evolved over time.
