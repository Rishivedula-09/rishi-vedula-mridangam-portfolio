## What is Adi Tala?

Adi Tala is one of the most common tala structures in Carnatic music.  
It is an **8-beat cycle** and is often counted in grouped structure.

Even though it totals 8 beats, the internal grouping helps maintain structure and flow.

## Tala Structure (8 Beats)

A common way to count Adi Tala is:

1 2 3 4 | 5 6 | 7 8

This grouping helps maintain alignment across the cycle.

## Patterns I Practiced (typed from notes)

(Paste Rishi’s exact Adi Tala patterns here, typed exactly.)

## Understanding the Structure

While practicing Adi Tala, I noticed that:
- each cycle must complete all 8 beats
- patterns can be grouped in different ways (4+2+2, 2+2+2+2, etc.)
- the most important part is landing correctly when the cycle repeats

This helped me understand how tala cycles create a stable structure for rhythm.

## Early Connections I Notice (Patterns & Logic)

Adi Tala feels like a repeating loop:
- the cycle repeats every 8 beats
- internal grouping helps keep structure
- accuracy depends on counting and consistent timing

This is similar to pattern-based thinking where repetition and alignment matter.

## Reflection (to be added gradually)

(Observations from practice and learning will be added over time.)
