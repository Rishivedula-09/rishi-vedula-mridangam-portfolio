# Notes / Research Log

This page is a dated log of what I’m learning as I explore rhythm, patterns, and connections to math and computer science.

I update this page as I learn new ideas, test them in practice, and improve my understanding through lessons, reading, and observation.

## 2024 – Early Curiosity and First Ideas

**Summer 2024 — Europe Trip (Paris & Switzerland)**
During a family trip to Paris, I visited the Louvre Museum and learned about Leonardo da Vinci.

**What I learned:**
Da Vinci was both an artist and a mathematician.
His work showed how art, structure, symmetry, and mathematics connect.

**What I noticed:**
Patterns and structure appear in many fields — art, architecture, music, and design.

**Impact on my thinking:**
This experience made me curious about how patterns and structure appear in music and whether they connect to math and logic.

This became the starting point for exploring rhythm more deeply.

---

## Fall 2024 — Beginning Pattern Awareness

**What I learned:**
While practicing mridangam, I started noticing that rhythm is not random.
It follows structured cycles that repeat and resolve.

**What I noticed:**
Repeating patterns requires consistency in timing and structure.
Small differences in hand position change sound and rhythm clarity.

**Questions I had:**
How can rhythm cycles be represented visually?
Can patterns be mapped using numbers or diagrams?

---

## Spring 2025 — Exploring Structure and Logic

**What I explored:**
I began exploring basic ideas about patterns, structure, and logical thinking through beginner-friendly math and problem-solving resources.

**Key ideas that interested me:**

* Pattern recognition
* Structured repetition
* Counting systems
* Logical sequencing

**Connection I began noticing:**
Tala cycles in music behave like repeating structured systems.

---

## Summer 2025 — Music and Structure Connection

Continued mridangam practice and began observing:

* Rhythm patterns repeat like loops
* Tala cycles behave like structured systems
* Korvais require planning and prediction
* Pauses must be counted as part of structure

**Realization:**
Rhythm is not only performance — it involves planning, counting, and structured thinking.

---

## Fall 2025 — Project Formation (Grade 11)

**Challenge:**
I wanted to explain how rhythm connects to math and structured thinking but initially found it difficult to express clearly.

**What I did:**
With guidance and research, I decided to document my learning journey in a structured way.

**Actions taken:**

* Designed a GitHub portfolio structure
* Created sections for lessons, patterns, and reflections
* Began writing structured explanations for each tala and korvai
* Started documenting observations instead of only practicing

This is when the project officially began.

---

## Winter 2025–2026 — Active Build Phase

Completed and documented:

* 8 Matrai lessons
* 16 Matrai lessons
* Adi Tala and Adi Tala Korvai
* Rupaka Tala and Rupaka Tala Korvai
* Mishra Chapu and Mishra Chapu Korvai
* Kanda Chapu and Kanda Chapu Korvai
* Music → Math → Computer Science connections

Built and published a GitHub Pages portfolio to organize and present learning.

## 2026-02-08 — Why Rhythm Feels Like Structure

**What I learned:**
Rhythm follows a repeating cycle and must stay consistent.
Maintaining posture, timing, and sound quality affects structure.

**What I noticed:**
Repeating patterns many times helps identify small variations.
Consistency improves clarity and control.

**Question:**
How can a rhythm cycle be represented clearly using diagrams or tables?

---

## 2026-02-08 — Thinking About Cycles and Repetition

**What I learned:**
A tala cycle repeats, and patterns fit inside it.
This feels similar to loops in programming.

**What I noticed:**
Some reset points in rhythm feel natural, while others require careful counting.

**Questions:**
How can reset points be represented using math?
Is there a simple way to visualize rhythm cycles like modular systems?

---

## February 2026 — Rhythm Observation and Listening

I watched a konnakkol demonstration by Sri Somashekar Jois and observed how rhythmic patterns are spoken and structured before being played.

**What I learned:**
Speaking rhythm helps understand structure before performance.

I also explored videos from the RhythMATRIX series featuring Vidwan Shri K. V. Prasad.

**What I observed:**

* Speed control requires internal counting
* Complex patterns still follow structured grouping
* Precision comes from planning and repetition

**How this helps my project:**
I am thinking about how to develop my own videos to demonstrate structured rhythm learning clearly.

---

## Books and Ideas Explored

Some beginner-friendly readings and ideas that influenced my thinking:

* *How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking* — Jordan Ellenberg (selected concepts)
* Introductory resources on pattern recognition and logical thinking
* Articles and videos connecting rhythm and mathematics
* Observations from music demonstrations and lessons

These helped me begin connecting rhythm with structured thinking and problem solving.

---

## Current Focus (2026)

Next steps for this project:

* Add structured practice videos
* Create short explanation videos connecting rhythm and patterns
* Continue documenting lessons and korvais
* Explore visual representations of rhythm cycles
* Expand connections between music, math, and computer science

This is an ongoing long-term learning project documenting how structured rhythm connects with analytical thinking.
