# Notes / Research Log

This page is a dated log of what I’m learning as I explore rhythm, patterns, and connections to math and computer science. I update it over time as I learn new ideas, test them in practice, and improve my understanding.

## 2026-02-08 — Why rhythm feels like “structure”

**What I learned:**  
Rhythm is not random. It follows a cycle and repeats in a structured way. When I practice patterns, I have to stay consistent with timing, posture, and sound.

**What I noticed:**  
Repeating a pattern many times helps me hear small differences. If my hand position changes, the sound changes.

**Questions I have:**  
How can I represent a rhythm cycle clearly in a simple diagram or table?

## 2026-02-08 — Thinking about cycles and repetition

**What I learned:**  
A tala cycle repeats, and patterns fit inside it. That feels similar to a loop in programming, where something repeats in steps.

**What I noticed:**  
Some patterns feel “natural” to repeat, and some feel harder because the reset point is less obvious.

**Questions I have:**  
What is a simple way to represent “reset points” using math (like counting or modulo)?
