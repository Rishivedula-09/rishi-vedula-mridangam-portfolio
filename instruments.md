# Instruments I Play

This page describes the percussion instruments I have learned and what each one has taught me about rhythm, timing, and coordination. This page will continue to grow as I learn more.

##  Mridangam: Rhythm, Culture, and Mathematical Thinking

##  1. What is the Mridangam?

### The mridangam is a classical percussion instrument from South India and the primary rhythm instrument used in Carnatic music. It is a double-sided drum played with both hands and can produce both bass and sharp tonal sounds.

The word mridangam comes from Sanskrit:
mrid – clay or earth
anga – body
Early versions were made using clay, while modern mridangams are made from wood and leather. The instrument is designed to create a wide range of rhythmic sounds and patterns.
While learning the mridangam, I am developing rhythm accuracy, coordination, and the ability to recognize complex patterns in sound.

## 2. Cultural and Historical Significance
###  The mridangam has a long history in Indian classical music and is sometimes called a “divine instrument” (Deva Vadyam).

In traditional stories and temple sculptures, it is associated with classical performances and divine musicians.
Because of its importance in Carnatic music, the mridangam is often considered the main percussion instrument in a Carnatic concert. It supports vocalists and instrumentalists by maintaining rhythm and enhancing the musical experience.
This cultural history makes learning the mridangam feel like being part of a long musical tradition.

## 3. My Journey Learning Mridangam

I started learning mridangam because I was interested in rhythm and Carnatic music.
As I continued practicing, I realized that mridangam is not just about keeping time — it involves understanding patterns, cycles, and structure.

Practicing regularly has helped me:
      Improve concentration
      Develop discipline
      Recognize repeating patterns
Listen carefully to rhythm changes

I also began noticing connections between rhythm patterns and mathematical thinking.

## 4. Understanding Rhythm in Carnatic Music
In Carnatic music, rhythm follows structured cycles called tāla.
Each tāla has a fixed number of beats that repeat.

For example, Adi Tāla has 8 beats:

1 2 3 4 | 5 6 | 7 8

The mridangam artist plays patterns within these cycles and must end at the correct beat.
This requires counting, timing, and precision.

Tha ka dhi mi

Learning these patterns feels like working with structured sequences.


## 5. How Rhythm Connects to Math and Logic

### While learning mridangam, I started seeing rhythm as patterns and numbers.

Many rhythm exercises involve:
        
        Dividing beats into smaller units
        Repeating patterns
        Ending exactly on the correct beat

This feels similar to solving math or logic problems.

Some rhythm patterns must repeat multiple times and still land perfectly on the final beat, which reminds me of loops and sequences in programming.
This made me curious about how music, math, and computer science are connected.



## 6. My Research and Exploration

### To learn more about the mridangam and its history, I explored these resources:

    Layapriya – Mridangam overview:                    https://layapriya.ca/mridangam/
    Wikipedia – Mridangam history and structure        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mridangam

I also watch performances and lessons online to better understand rhythm patterns and techniques.



##  7. What I Want to Explore Next
####  In the future, I want to explore:
        How rhythm patterns relate to mathematical sequences
        How music and computer science connect
        How different percussion instruments approach rhythm


This website documents my learning journey and my exploration of rhythm, patterns, and logic.

## Snare Drum

I learned snare drum through my school band program. Playing snare drum helped me understand timing, counting, and coordination using sticks, which is different from playing with hands. I noticed similarities in rhythm patterns between snare drum and Mridangam.

## Marimba and Other Percussion

In middle school, I learned marimba, mallets, and synthesizer. These instruments helped me understand melody, harmony, and rhythm together. Learning different percussion instruments made it easier for me to adapt and recognize patterns across styles.
