# Instruments I Play

This page describes the percussion instruments I have learned and what each one has taught me about rhythm, timing, and coordination. This page will continue to grow as I learn more.

## Mridangam

Mridangam is the first percussion instrument I learned. Through Mridangam, I learned discipline, posture, hand coordination, and how rhythm is organized into cycles. Practicing daily helped me understand repetition, precision, and structure.

## Snare Drum

I learned snare drum through my school band program. Playing snare drum helped me understand timing, counting, and coordination using sticks, which is different from playing with hands. I noticed similarities in rhythm patterns between snare drum and Mridangam.

## Marimba and Other Percussion

In middle school, I learned marimba, mallets, and synthesizer. These instruments helped me understand melody, harmony, and rhythm together. Learning different percussion instruments made it easier for me to adapt and recognize patterns across styles.
