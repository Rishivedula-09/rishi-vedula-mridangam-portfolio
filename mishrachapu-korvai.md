## What is a Korvai in Mishra Chapu?

A korvai is a structured rhythmic pattern that repeats and resolves at the correct point in a tala cycle.

In this lesson, I practiced a korvai in Mishra Chapu.  
The goal was to maintain repetition, structure, and accurate landing at the end of the cycle.

## Tala Structure (Mishra Chapu)

Mishra Chapu follows a 7-beat cycle typically grouped as:

3 + 2 + 2

Count example:
1 2 3 | 4 5 | 6 7

The korvai must align correctly within this structure and resolve at the right point.

## Patterns I Learned (typed from my notes)

The following korvai patterns repeat and resolve within the Mishra Chapu cycle.

Tha ki ta Tha ka dhi mi | Tha ka jo nu (repeat)

Tha dhin gi na thom Tha ki ta | Tha dhin gi na thom (repeat)

Tha ka dhi mi | Tha ki ta | Tha dhin gi na thom (final landing)

Each korvai pattern is repeated in structured sequences and must resolve correctly at the start of the tala cycle.

All korvai patterns must stay aligned within the Mishra Chapu structure.


## Understanding the Korvai Structure

While practicing Mishra Chapu korvai, I noticed that repetition must stay aligned with the 3+2+2 grouping.

A korvai usually follows:
pattern → repeat → repeat → final landing

The final phrase must land correctly at the start of the cycle.  
This requires careful counting and timing consistency.

## Understanding the Structure

While practicing this korvai, I noticed:

- patterns repeat in structured sequences  
- repetition must stay aligned with tala  
- final landing must match the cycle start  
- internal counting is required for accuracy  

This helped improve timing and consistency.

---

## Thinking in Repetition and Cycles

A korvai is built using repeating rhythmic phrases:

pattern → repeat → repeat → final landing  

Maintaining alignment across repetitions ensures the korvai resolves correctly within the tala.

---

## Early Connections I Notice (Patterns & Logic)

Practicing korvai patterns requires:

- structured repetition  
- accurate counting  
- cycle alignment  
- consistent timing  

These ideas relate to structured sequences where repetition and alignment must remain precise.
