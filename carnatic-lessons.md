 Carnatic Rhythm Lessons

This page captures the Carnatic rhythm concepts I am learning through Mridangam. I am still a student, and this page reflects my understanding as it continues to grow.

## Tala (Rhythmic Cycle)

Tala is the rhythmic cycle that organizes beats in Carnatic music. It repeats in a fixed structure and helps musicians stay in sync. Learning tala helped me understand how repetition and counting work together in rhythm.

## Korvai (Structured Pattern)

A korvai is a structured rhythmic pattern that fits within a tala cycle. Practicing korvais taught me how smaller patterns combine to form longer sequences and how precision matters at transition points.

## Practice and Discipline

Carnatic rhythm requires daily practice and attention to posture, hand position, and sound quality. Through practice, I learned patience and consistency, and I am still improving every day.
