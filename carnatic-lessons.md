## Carnatic Rhythm Lessons – Learning Through Mridangam

# Carnatic Rhythm Lessons – Mridangam Practice

This section documents structured mridangam lessons that I have practiced over several years of training.  
Each lesson includes original handwritten notes, structured rhythm patterns, and explanations of tala and matrai.

These lessons reflect long-term discipline and help me understand rhythm as structured patterns built on timing and repetition.

All lessons shown here are based on actual practice and handwritten notes.
