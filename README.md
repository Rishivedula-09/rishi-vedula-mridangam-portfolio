## A Long-Term Exploration Through Mridangam

### Overview
This repository documents my long-term learning journey in Carnatic percussion (mridangam) and my growing interest in exploring rhythm through structured thinking, mathematics, and computer science.
I have been learning mridangam for more than eight years.
In my early years, I focused mainly on technique, timing, and performance. Over time, I became increasingly curious about how rhythmic patterns are structured, how they align within tala cycles, and how complex rhythmic sequences are built from smaller repeating units.
This project serves as a structured record of that exploration — combining music, analytical thinking, and long-term learning.

## Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to explore rhythm not only as a performance art but also as a structured system connected to mathematics, logic, and computational thinking.

Through this portfolio, I am studying:
      -  Construction of rhythmic patterns
      -  Tala structure and alignment
      -  Korvai design and resolution
      -  Pattern symmetry and grouping
      -  Mathematical representation of rhythm
      -  Algorithmic thinking through musical structure

Rather than viewing music and academic subjects separately, this project reflects how musical training can strengthen structured and logical thinking.

## Why I Started This Project
After many years of learning rhythm through practice and performance, I began to notice that rhythmic structures often resemble mathematical and logical systems.

For example:
      -  Patterns follow fixed counts and repeat in cycles
      -  Groupings create symmetry and variation
      -  Korvais require precise alignment and resolution
      -  Different pattern lengths interact in predictable ways

This led me to start documenting my learning in a more structured way — not only to improve as a percussionist, but also to better understand rhythm as a system involving structure, counting, and reasoning.

### Connections to Mathematics and Computer Science
As I continue learning, I am increasingly interested in how rhythm connects to mathematical and computational ideas.

Some of the connections I am exploring include:

| Rhythm Concept      | Mathematical / CS Parallel     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Tala cycles         | Modular counting systems       |
| Pattern repetition  | Iteration and loops            |
| Korvai construction | Algorithm design               |
| Beat alignment      | Logical termination conditions |
| Pattern variations  | Permutations and combinations  |
| Grouping structures | Data grouping and sequences    |


These connections are not formal research, but an ongoing exploration of how structured musical training can support analytical thinking.

### What I Am Learning Through This Project
This project helps me develop:

    -  Long-term discipline through music
    -  Structured thinking and analysis
    -  Pattern recognition and logical reasoning
    -  Connections between creative and analytical learning
    -  Curiosity about how different fields connect


It also allows me to document how my understanding evolves over time.

### Ongoing Development
This is a long-term evolving project.

Future additions may include:

      -  Additional rhythmic pattern explorations
      -  Mathematical visualization of rhythmic cycles
      -  ASCII and computational representations of rhythm
      -  Recorded demonstrations and explanations
      -  Continued research and reading notes

The goal is to continue building both musical understanding and structured analytical thinking.
