# From Music to Math to Computer Science

This page describes how my experience with rhythm and percussion has influenced the way I think about math, logic, and computer science. I am still learning, and these ideas are part of an ongoing exploration.

## Rhythm as Structure

When I practice Mridangam, rhythm is organized into cycles. Patterns repeat in a fixed order, and timing must stay consistent. This helped me realize that rhythm is structured, not random.

## Patterns and Repetition

Writing rhythm patterns using syllables helps me see repetition clearly. Playing the same pattern many times feels similar to repeating steps in a process. If I make a small mistake, the whole pattern changes, which taught me the importance of accuracy.

## Connecting Rhythm to Math

In math, numbers follow rules and patterns. Rhythm cycles feel similar to counting and grouping numbers. Practicing tala helped me understand ideas like sequence, grouping, and reset points.

## Early Interest in Computer Science

In high school, I was introduced to computer science and basic programming concepts. When I learned about loops and step-by-step logic, they felt familiar because of my experience with rhythm patterns. I am interested in learning more about how structured thinking in music connects to computing.

## What I Want to Explore Next

- Representing rhythm cycles using simple diagrams or tables  
- Understanding how repetition and reset points relate to loops  
- Learning basic programming concepts and applying them to patterns
