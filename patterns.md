# Rhythm Patterns (Solkattu) and Practice

This page documents rhythm patterns (solkattu/bols) that I practice on Mridangam. I write them in syllables because it helps me remember structure, timing, and how patterns fit into a cycle. Over time, I will add more patterns and link short practice videos.

## Pattern 1: Tha Ka Dhi Mi

**Syllables:**


**What I notice:**
- This is a simple 4-beat pattern.
- I can repeat it many times to stay in steady rhythm.
- It helps me practice consistency and speed control.

## Pattern 2: Tha Dhin Dhin Tha

**Syllables:**


**What I notice:**
- This pattern has a clear beginning and ending.
- Playing it slowly helps me improve sound clarity.
- I practice keeping the same tempo across the whole cycle.

## Pattern 3 (Example): Tha Dhin Gi Na Thom

**Syllables:**


**What I notice:**
- This feels longer and more complex than a 4-beat pattern.
- I pay attention to where the pattern “resets” when repeating.
- Practicing this improves my control and precision.

## Videos (Coming Soon)

I plan to add short videos (about 3–5 minutes each) to demonstrate these patterns at slow speed and normal speed.
