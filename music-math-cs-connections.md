# Music, Math, and Computer Science Connections

This is a central page where I connect my mridangam lessons to ideas in mathematics and computer science.

As I continue learning rhythm and studying math and computer science in school, I am starting to notice similarities between:

- rhythmic cycles and number patterns  
- grouping of beats and mathematical structure  
- repeating patterns and programming logic  

This page will grow over time as I continue learning and exploring these connections.

## Purpose of this Page

For each lesson, I will gradually add notes showing:

- how rhythm connects to math  
- how patterns connect to computer science  
- how structured thinking appears in music  

This will develop slowly as I continue practicing and learning.
