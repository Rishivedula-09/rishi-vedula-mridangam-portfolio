# Music, Math, and Computer Science Connections

This page connects my mridangam lessons to ideas in mathematics and computer science.

As I continue learning rhythm and studying math and computer science in school, I am beginning to notice similarities between:

- rhythmic cycles and number patterns  
- grouping of beats and mathematical structure  
- repeating patterns and programming logic  
- structured musical thinking and algorithmic problem solving  

Each tala and korvai has its own structure, counting method, and resolution rules.  
This page brings together those connections in one place and will continue to grow as I keep learning.

## 8 Matrai → Math and Computer Science

8 matrai patterns form balanced rhythmic structures.

**Math connections**
- Fixed count of 8 units  
- Balanced divisions such as 4+4  
- Symmetry and structured counting  
- Patterns must resolve correctly within a cycle  

**Computer science connections**
- Patterns behave like ordered sequences  
- Repetition resembles loops  
- Pattern design follows algorithmic thinking  
- Each structure must satisfy logical constraints

## 8 Matrai → Math and Computer Science

In this lesson I practice rhythmic patterns built on 8 matrai (units).  
While learning and repeating these patterns, I started noticing how rhythm connects naturally to ideas in mathematics and computer science.

### Math connections I observe

- The total count is always 8.
- 8 can be divided into different groupings:
  - 4 + 4
  - 2 + 2 + 4
  - 2 + 2 + 2 + 2
- Even when the internal grouping changes, the total remains the same.
- A rhythmic phrase must complete exactly within the 8-count structure.
- This reflects mathematical ideas such as number partitioning and modular counting.
- If a pattern does not complete within 8, it must be adjusted to land correctly.

### Computer science connections I observe

- Each bol (tha, kita, thaka) acts like a small building block.
- A full 8-matrai cycle feels like a fixed container that must be filled correctly.
- Repeating patterns feels similar to loops in programming.
- Smaller groupings inside the 8-beat cycle feel like nested structures.
- When creating a korvai, I must check whether the pattern fits exactly into the cycle.
- This feels similar to designing and testing an algorithm so that it produces a correct result.
