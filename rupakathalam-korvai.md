# Lesson 6: Rupaka Tala Korvai

## What is a Korvai in Rupaka Tala?

A korvai is a structured rhythmic pattern that repeats and resolves precisely within a tala cycle.

In this lesson, I practiced a korvai in Rupaka Tala.  
The goal was to maintain repetition, structure, and correct landing at the end of the cycle.

## Tala Structure (Rupaka Tala)

Rupaka Tala follows a repeating cycle that must remain balanced.

Example grouping:
1 2 | 3 4 | 5 6

Each korvai must align correctly within the cycle and resolve at the right point.

## Patterns I Practiced (typed from notes)

## Understanding the Structure

While practicing this korvai, I noticed:

- patterns repeat in structured sequences  
- repetition must stay aligned with the tala  
- final landing must match the start of the cycle  

Maintaining alignment across repetitions improves timing and control.

---

## Thinking in Repetition and Cycles

A korvai is built using repeated rhythmic phrases.

pattern → repeat → repeat → final landing  

This creates a structured sequence that must resolve correctly within the tala.

## Early Connections I Notice (Patterns & Logic)

Practicing korvai patterns helped me observe:

- structured repetition  
- cycle alignment  
- consistent timing  
- precise completion  

These ideas relate to structured sequences and pattern-based thinking where repetition and timing are important.

## Reflection (to be added gradually)

I will continue adding observations as I practice and improve my understanding of rhythmic structures and korvai patterns.
